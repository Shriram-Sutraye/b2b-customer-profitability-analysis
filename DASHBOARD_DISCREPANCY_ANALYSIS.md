# 🖼️ vs 📝 Dashboard Consistency Analysis

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Reviewer:** Gemini Agent

This report analyzes the **contradictions** between the **Dashboard Images** (Visuals) and the **Written Narrative** (Text) in `README_v2.md`.

There is a fundamental disconnect: The Dashboard Images reflect the **Actual Data** (which reveals deep structural issues), while the Written Narrative describes a **Fictional Scenario** (where the business is perfect except for a few outliers).

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Customer Profitability Segmentation

**File:** `powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot From 2025-11-20 22-54-18.png`

| Feature | 🖼️ **What the Image Shows** (Based on Data) | 📝 **What the Text Claims** | ⚖️ **Verdict** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C-Tier Size** | **Massive Red Bar** (287 customers / 65%) | "C-Tier (4 customers, 1%)" | ❌ **MISMATCH** |
| **A-Tier Size** | **Minority Green Bar** (149 customers / 34%) | "A-Tier (287 customers, 65%)" | ❌ **MISMATCH** |
| **Core Insight** | **The Business Model is Broken.** The majority of customers are losing money. | "The company doesn't have a revenue problem... [it's] a small, identifiable subset." | ❌ **CONTRADICTION** |
| **Pareto Principle** | **Inverted.** Bottom 65% destroy value. | Claims standard "80/20" rule applies. | ❌ **FALSE** |

**🕵️‍♂️ Analysis:**
The text describes a "1% Problem" (easy to fix). The image reveals a **"65% Problem"** (requires restructuring). The narrative tries to minimize a catastrophe that the dashboard clearly visualizes.

## 📈 Dashboard 2: Strategic Scenario Modeling

**File:** `powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot From 2025-11-20 22-54-38.png`

| Feature | 🖼️ **What the Image Shows** (Based on Data) | 📝 **What the Text Claims** | ⚖️ **Verdict** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Renegotiation Value** | Bar Chart reaching **~€2.4M - €2.5M** | "**€3.0M** annual profit opportunity" | ⚠️ **EXAGGERATED** |
| **Status Quo** | Bar Chart at **~€80k** | "€0.02M" (20k) | ⚠️ **INACCURATE** |
| **Scenario Ranking** | Shows "Exit C-Tier" as highly effective (~€1.6M) | Text downplays Exit strategy vs Renegotiation. | 🟡 **SUBJECTIVE** |

**🕵️‍♂️ Analysis:**
The text inflates the potential profit upside by **~20%** compared to what the scenario bars likely display. While the *ranking* of options might match, the *magnitude* of the promise in the text is unsupported by the visual evidence.

## 🚛 Dashboard 3: Operational Cost Forensics

**File:** `powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot From 2025-11-20 22-54-45.png`

| Feature | 🖼️ **What the Image Shows** (Based on Data) | 📝 **What the Text Claims** | ⚖️ **Verdict** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Return Rate** | Gauge/Card showing **7.8%** | "Company return rate: 7.80%" | ✅ **MATCH** |
| **Cost Drivers** | Bar chart showing **Fresh** as highest cost | "Fresh Products: €3.0M (highest)" | ✅ **MATCH** |
| **Net Margin** | KPI Card showing **0.57%** | "Net Margin: 0.57%" | ✅ **MATCH** |

**🕵️‍♂️ Analysis:**
This is the only section where the Text and Image seem aligned. The operational metrics are factual and consistent.

## 🚩 Summary of Failures

| Dashboard | Visual vs Text Consistency | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Segmentation** | 🔴 **CRITICAL FAILURE** | The text describes a completely different customer base than the visual. |
| **Scenarios** | 🟡 **MODERATE FAILURE** | The text over-promises ROI compared to the visual projection. |
| **Operations** | 🟢 **PASS** | Visuals and text tell the same story. |

## 💡 Corrective Actions for README_v2.md

1.  **Rewrite the Segmentation Section:**
    *   **Delete:** "While C-tier customers represent only 1%..."
    *   **Replace with:** "C-tier customers represent **65% of the base**, indicating a structural pricing failure for the mass market."
2.  **Fix Customer Counts:**
    *   A-Tier: 149 (not 287)
    *   C-Tier: 287 (not 4)
3.  **Calibrate Promises:**
    *   Change "€3M Opportunity" to "**€2.5M Opportunity**".
