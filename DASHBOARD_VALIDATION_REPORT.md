# 🕵️‍♂️ Dashboard Data Validation Report

**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES FOUND**

This report compares the narrative claims in `README_v2.md` against the actual "Ground Truth" data generated by the project scripts.

---

## 🚨 1. The "1% Problem" vs. The "65% Problem"
**Severity:** 🔥 **CRITICAL**

The README builds its entire narrative around the idea that a tiny minority of customers are destroying value. **The data proves the exact opposite.**

| Metric | README Claim (Dashboard 1) | Ground Truth Data (CSV) | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C-Tier Customer Count** | **4** (1%) | **287** (65%) | ❌ **FALSE** |
| **A-Tier Customer Count** | **287** (65%) | **149** (34%) | ❌ **FALSE** |
| **B-Tier Customer Count** | **149** (34%) | **4** (1%) | ❌ **FALSE** |
| **C-Tier Financial Impact** | -€1.3M Loss | -€1.25M Loss | ✅ **ACCURATE** |

**💥 Impact:**
*   The README claims the business is healthy except for "1% of bad apples".
*   The Data shows the business is **structurally unprofitable for the majority (65%) of its customers**.
*   **Correction Needed:** The narrative must change from "Fire the 1%" to "Restructure the Business Model for the Mass Market".

## 📉 2. Profit Opportunity Exaggeration
**Severity:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**

| Metric | README Claim (Dashboard 2) | Ground Truth Data (Scenario Model) | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Status Quo Profit** | €0.02M | €0.08M | ⚠️ **Understated** |
| **Renegotiation Scenario** | **€3.0M** | **€2.45M** | ⚠️ **Overstated (~20%)** |

**📝 Note:** The "€3M" figure likely comes from an optimistic manual projection, whereas the rigorous simulation (`14_scenario_planning.csv`) projects **€2.45M** even with aggressive price increases (+20%).

## ✅ 3. Operational Metrics (Verified)
**Severity:** 🟢 **PASS**

The operational diagnostics are largely accurate and supported by the data.

| Metric | README Claim (Dashboard 3) | Ground Truth Data | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Return Rate** | 7.80% | 7.80% (Transaction Count basis) | ✅ **ACCURATE** |
| **Fresh Product Cost** | €3.0M (Highest) | €3.03M (Operational Costs Only) | ✅ **ACCURATE** |
| **Net Margin** | 0.57% | 0.57% | ✅ **ACCURATE** |

## 🧩 4. Data Consistency Summary

| Dashboard | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dashboard 1 (Segmentation)** | 🔴 **FAIL** | Customer counts are completely inverted. The "Pyramid" is upside down. |
| **Dashboard 2 (Scenarios)** | 🟡 **WARNING** | Profit potential is exaggerated by €500k+. |
| **Dashboard 3 (Operations)** | 🟢 **PASS** | Operational forensics are precise and accurate. |

## 🛠 Recommended Actions

1.  **Rewrite Executive Summary:** Stop referencing "4 customers" or "1%". Acknowledge that **65%** of the customer base is unprofitable.
2.  **Update Dashboard 1 Text:** The segmentation visual (if generated from this data) would show a massive red bar for C-Tier (287 customers), not a tiny slice. The text must match this reality.
3.  **Adjust Profit Claims:** Lower the "€3M" promise to a more defensible "**€2.5M**".
