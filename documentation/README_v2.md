# B2B Customer Profitability Analysis
### A Data-Driven Framework to Recover €3M in Hidden Profit

---

## Executive Summary

I analyzed a B2B wholesale distributor generating €14.6M in annual revenue but operating at near-breakeven (0.57% net margin). Despite industry-standard gross margins of 40%, the company was hemorrhaging value between gross profit and the bottom line.

Through comprehensive financial modeling and scenario analysis, I identified a **€3M annual profit opportunity** by addressing three core issues: unprofitable customer relationships, operational inefficiencies in perishable logistics, and suboptimal payment term structures.

**Key Results:**
- Identified 71 C-tier customers destroying €1.3M in annual value
- Quantified €500K+ savings opportunity in return rate optimization
- Developed actionable renegotiation framework with clear ROI projection
- Built executive-ready analytics framework requiring zero technical implementation

## The Business Challenge

**Context:** A 440-customer B2B distributor with the following financial profile:

| Financial Metric | Actual Performance | Industry Benchmark | Assessment |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Annual Revenue | €14.62M | N/A | Healthy top-line |
| Gross Margin | 40.00% | 38-42% | Within normal range |
| Net Margin | 0.57% | 3-5% | **Critical underperformance** |
| Days Sales Outstanding | 52 days | <45 days | Above target |

**The Core Problem:** The company was experiencing a 97% margin erosion between gross profit and net income. While revenue generation and initial margins appeared healthy, something was systematically destroying value downstream.

**My Mandate:** Diagnose the root causes of margin erosion, quantify the financial impact, and develop a prescriptive action plan with clear implementation pathways.

---

## Analytical Approach

I built a three-phase diagnostic framework designed to answer progressively deeper questions:

### Phase 1: Diagnosis
**Question:** Where is the profit disappearing?

### Phase 2: Prescription  
**Question:** What specific actions would recover profitability?

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis
**Question:** Why are operational costs so elevated?

This framework is presented through three executive dashboards that tell a complete business story without requiring technical infrastructure or code deployment.

## Dashboard 1: Customer Profitability Segmentation

**Purpose:** Quantify customer-level value contribution and identify unprofitable relationships.

![Customer Profitability Analysis](../powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot%20From%202025-11-20%2022-54-18.png)

### Key Findings

**Customer Segmentation Results:**
- **A-Tier (287 customers, 65%):** High-value accounts generating positive returns
- **B-Tier (149 customers, 34%):** Moderate-value accounts with acceptable margins
- **C-Tier (4 customers, 1%):** Value-destroying accounts with negative contribution

**The Critical Insight:**  
While C-tier customers represent only 1% of the customer base, they generate **€1.3M in annual losses**. This single segment is solely responsible for the company's near-breakeven status.

**Additional Observations:**
1. Revenue trends remain stable across the 12-month analysis period
2. Profit volatility is increasing despite stable revenue
3. Strong positive correlation exists between Customer Lifetime Value and profitability
4. The profitability distribution follows a classic power law (Pareto principle confirmed)

**The Margin Gap:**
- Gross Margin: 40.0%
- Net Margin: 0.57%
- **Unaccounted margin erosion: 39.43 percentage points**

This dashboard establishes the business case: the company doesn't have a revenue problem—it has a value leakage problem concentrated in a small, identifiable customer subset.

## Dashboard 2: Strategic Scenario Modeling

**Purpose:** Evaluate alternative strategic interventions and quantify expected ROI for each option.

![Strategic Scenario Analysis](../powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot%20From%202025-11-20%2022-54-38.png)

### Scenario Evaluation Framework

I modeled five distinct strategic pathways to assess profit recovery potential:

| Strategic Option | Projected Annual Profit | Execution Complexity | Implementation Risk | Recommendation |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Status Quo | €0.02M | N/A | N/A | Unacceptable baseline |
| **Renegotiate C-Tier Terms** | **€3.0M** | Low | Low | **Primary recommendation** |
| Exit C-Tier Relationships | €1.6M | Medium | Medium | Viable alternative |
| Exit SMB Segment | €0.8M | High | High | Not recommended |
| Enterprise-Only Focus | €0.8M | High | High | Not recommended |

### Recommended Strategy: C-Tier Renegotiation

The optimal path forward involves renegotiating commercial terms with the 71 identified C-tier customers through one or more of the following mechanisms:

1. **Price Adjustment:** 15-20% price increase to reflect true cost-to-serve
2. **Payment Terms Modification:** Transition from Net-90 to Net-30 terms
3. **Minimum Order Quantity:** Implement €200 minimum order value
4. **Relationship Exit:** Terminate unprofitable relationships as last resort

**Expected Outcome:** €3.0M annual profit improvement with minimal execution risk.

### Cost Structure Analysis

The stacked cost breakdown reveals several critical insights:
- COGS represents the largest absolute cost (expected in wholesale distribution)
- Warehouse and fulfillment costs are disproportionately high relative to revenue
- Interest costs from extended payment terms are material and measurable
- Overhead allocation creates additional burden on already thin margins

### Customer Risk Stratification

I categorized the entire customer base by financial health:
- **51% classified as "Optimal":** Strong margins, reliable payment, low service cost
- **23% classified as "Extreme Risk":** Negative margins requiring immediate intervention
- **13% classified as "Risky":** Borderline profitability requiring monitoring
- **13% classified as "Unsustainable":** Cannot be served profitably under current model

## Dashboard 3: Operational Cost Forensics

**Purpose:** Identify specific operational drivers of elevated costs and margin erosion.

![Operational Cost Analysis](../powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot%20From%202025-11-20%2022-54-45.png)

### Critical Operational Findings

**1. Return Rate Crisis**

Current State:
- **Company return rate:** 7.80%
- **Industry benchmark:** 3-5%
- **Performance gap:** 2x industry standard

Root Cause Analysis:
- Fresh and Grocery product categories drive 60% of total returns
- Strong correlation with perishable goods suggests cold chain failures
- Product quality issues at time of delivery

Financial Impact:
- Direct reverse logistics costs
- Lost margin on returned goods
- Customer satisfaction deterioration

**2. Order Cost Volatility**

Average cost per order fluctuates between €370 and €405 across the analysis period, indicating:
- Demand forecasting challenges
- Fulfillment process inconsistency
- Potential capacity utilization issues

**3. Product-Level Cost Attribution**

Total operational cost by product category:
- Fresh Products: €3.0M (highest cost category)
- Milk: €1.0M
- Grocery: €0.8M
- Other categories: €1.86M combined

**4. Cost Component Trends**

Analysis of cost evolution over time reveals:
- Warehouse costs dominate fixed operational expenses
- Shipping costs remain relatively stable (efficient logistics partnerships)
- Return costs spike periodically (quality control events)
- Overhead creep visible in later months

## Business Case: €3M Profit Recovery Framework

### Immediate Priority Actions

**Action 1: C-Tier Customer Renegotiation** (71 accounts)

Implementation Options:
- Increase pricing 15-20% to reflect actual cost-to-serve OR
- Enforce Net-30 payment terms to reduce working capital burden OR
- Implement €200 minimum order value to eliminate uneconomical transactions OR
- Exit relationships where renegotiation fails

**Expected Impact:** +€3.0M annual profit  
**Timeline:** 90-120 days  
**Risk Level:** Low (contractual renegotiation is standard business practice)

**Action 2: Return Rate Optimization** (7.80% → 3% target)

Implementation Approach:
- Conduct cold chain logistics audit for Fresh/Grocery categories
- Implement enhanced quality control at packaging stage
- Partner with specialized cold chain logistics providers
- Establish vendor quality scorecards

**Expected Impact:** €500K+ annual savings  
**Timeline:** 120-180 days  
**Risk Level:** Medium (requires operational process redesign)

**Action 3: Minimum Order Quantity Policy** (€200 threshold)

Implementation Approach:
- Analyze order size distribution and margin correlation
- Define exceptions framework for strategic accounts
- Communicate policy changes to affected customers
- Monitor order consolidation behavior

**Expected Impact:** €200K+ annual savings  
**Timeline:** 30-60 days  
**Risk Level:** Low (standard wholesale practice)

### Secondary Optimization Opportunities

**Action 4: Payment Terms Standardization**

Enforce Net-30 terms across customer base to:
- Reduce DSO from 52 to 45 days
- Lower working capital requirements
- Decrease interest expense by €52K annually

**Action 5: Perishable Product Logistics Partnership**

Engage specialized cold chain providers to:
- Reduce Fresh/Grocery spoilage rates
- Improve delivery quality and reliability
- Lower return rates through better handling

## Technical Methodology

### Data Engineering Foundation

I synthesized a realistic B2B wholesale dataset comprising:
- 14,489 individual transactions
- 440 unique customers across three segments
- 12-month historical performance period
- Full cost attribution across six expense categories

### Financial Modeling Approach

I built a comprehensive Activity-Based Costing (ABC) model that attributes costs as follows:

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Bill of Materials × Quantity Sold  
**Warehouse Costs:** Pick/pack labor based on order complexity  
**Shipping Costs:** Weight-based calculation with urgency premiums  
**Return Costs:** Reverse logistics by product perishability  
**Interest Costs:** Payment terms × applicable interest rate × DSO  
**Overhead Allocation:** Customer segment-based distribution

### Customer Segmentation Logic

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation with NPV discounting:
- **A-Tier:** Top 65th percentile by CLV (287 customers)
- **B-Tier:** 35th-65th percentile by CLV (149 customers)  
- **C-Tier:** Bottom 35th percentile with negative contribution (4 customers)

### Scenario Planning Framework

Five distinct scenarios modeled with full P&L impact:
1. Status Quo (baseline)
2. C-Tier relationship exit
3. SMB segment exit
4. Enterprise-only strategy
5. C-Tier renegotiation (recommended approach)

Each scenario includes revenue impact, cost structure changes, and net margin implications.

## Key Insights

**The 1% Problem**  
C-tier customers represent 1% of the customer base but destroy 100% of potential profitability through negative margin contribution of €1.3M annually.

**Margin Leakage Architecture**  
97% of gross margin (39.43 of 40 percentage points) disappears between gross profit and net income, creating a profitability crisis despite healthy top-line performance.

**Return Rate Economics**  
At 7.80%, the company's return rate is nearly double the wholesale industry benchmark of 3-5%, driven primarily by perishable product categories.

**Payment Terms Tax**  
Extended Net-90 payment terms create a €52K annual interest expense while tying up significant working capital.

**Small Order Problem**  
Orders below €200 consistently demonstrate negative unit economics due to fixed fulfillment costs.
