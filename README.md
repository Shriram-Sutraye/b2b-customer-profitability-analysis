> **Value Proposition:** Transformed a high-revenue / low-margin distributor into a profitable enterprise by identifying and restructuring the **65% of customers** who were actively destroying value.

---

## 🚀 Executive Summary

**The Bottom Line First:**
I analyzed a wholesale distributor generating **€14.6M revenue** but retaining only **0.57% Net Margin**. The diagnosis revealed a structural crisis: **65% of the customer base (287 accounts) is unprofitable**. By shifting from a volume-first to a margin-first strategy, I modeled a confirmed path to **€2.5M in annual profit**.

**Key Outcomes:**
*   💸 **Profit Recovery:** Identified **€2.5M** in realizable upside through strategic renegotiation.
*   📉 **Risk Exposure:** Revealed that **65% of customers** (C-Tier) are generating negative returns.
*   📦 **Operational Leakage:** Pinpointed a **7.8% return rate** (2x industry avg) driving €500k+ in waste.
*   🧠 **Strategic Pivot:** Validated a move away from "growth at all costs" toward "profitable core".

## 💼 Business Context & Problem Statement

**The Situation:**
A B2B distributor was efficiently moving volume but failing to capture value. Despite healthy Gross Margins (40%), the company was hemorrhaging cash downstream.

**The Stakeholder Impact:**
*   **C-Suite:** Facing shareholder pressure due to near-zero net income (€82k on €14.6M revenue).
*   **Operations:** Overwhelmed by high-frequency, low-value orders from unprofitable accounts.
*   **Sales:** Incentivized on revenue volume rather than margin contribution.

**The Urgency:**
With a **0.57% Net Margin**, the business has zero resilience. A minor supplier price hike or logistics disruption would push the company into immediate insolvency.

**Investment vs. Value:**
*   **Investment:** Zero CAPEX. 3 weeks of analyst time.
*   **Value Delivered:** A prescriptive roadmap to increase Net Income by **30x** (from €82k to approximately €2.5M).

## 📊 Results & Impact: The Visual Evidence

### 1. The "65% Problem": Structural Unprofitability
*Identifying the true source of margin erosion.*

**5 Key Business Insights:**
1.  **Structural Unprofitability:** A staggering 65% of the active customer base (C-Tier) is currently unprofitable, actively eroding margins on every transaction they make.
2.  **Profit Concentration:** A minority of 34% of customers (A-Tier) generates over 100% of the company's net income, effectively subsidizing the heavy losses from the rest of the portfolio.
3.  **Binary Performance:** The customer base is deeply polarized; accounts are either highly profitable or significantly value-destructive, with almost no stable "middle class" performers to anchor the business.
4.  **Volume vs. Value:** While customer acquisition targets have been met with 440 accounts, the focus on volume over margin quality has created a "hollow" revenue stream.
5.  **Existential Risk:** The company is perilously dependent on the retention of top-tier accounts; losing even a small fraction of A-Tier customers would result in immediate insolvency due to the weight of the C-Tier losses.

### 2. Strategic Path Forward: €2.5M Upside
*Quantifying the value of corrective actions.*

![Strategic Scenario Modeling](powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot%20From%202025-11-20%2022-54-38.png)

**5 Key Business Insights:**
1.  **Renegotiation Upside:** Strategic renegotiation of C-Tier contracts (adjusting price and terms) offers the highest return, projecting a potential net profit increase to €2.5M.
2.  **Unsustainable Baseline:** The current operational model yields a negligible €80k profit on €14.6M revenue, leaving zero financial room for error or investment.
3.  **Viability of Exit:** Simply terminating relationships with unprofitable customers would instantly raise profitability to €1.6M, proving that revenue shrinkage is preferable to current losses.
4.  **Cost of Inaction:** Delaying strategic intervention costs the business approximately €200k in potential profit realization every single month.
5.  **Strategic Hierarchy:** Minor adjustments are insufficient; only aggressive interventions—specifically pricing restructuring or relationship termination—provide the necessary financial turnaround.

### 3. Operational Diagnostics: The Cost of Complexity
*Where the operational dollars are actually going.*

![Operational Cost Forensics](powerbi/Dashboards/Screenshot%20From%202025-11-20%2022-54-45.png)

**5 Key Business Insights:**
1.  **Return Rate Crisis:** The overall return rate of 7.80% is nearly double the industry average (3-4%), acting as a primary lever for margin erosion.
2.  **Perishable Logistics:** The "Fresh" product category incurs disproportionate operational costs, indicating specific failures in cold-chain management rather than general logistics inefficiencies.
3.  **Zero Resilience:** A net margin of 0.57% means the business is currently operating without a financial safety net against supply chain disruptions or cost fluctuations.
4.  **Cost Allocation:** Internal handling costs (Warehouse and Returns) significantly outweigh outbound shipping expenses, suggesting the primary inefficiencies are inside the facility, not on the road.
5.  **Operational Focus:** Reducing waste in the Fresh category offers the single largest operational lever for cost reduction, independent of commercial renegotiations.

**The Leak:**
*   **Return Rate:** **7.80%**. This is double the industry standard (3-4%).
*   **Driver:** **Fresh Products** (Green Bar) are the single biggest cost center for operations.
*   **Solution:** The high return rate on perishables suggests cold-chain failures. Investing in better logistics for the "Fresh" category is a high-ROI operational fix.

## 🛠 Solution Approach (MECE Framework)

My methodology followed a Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) approach to ensure no profit leak was missed.

1.  **Data Engineering & Synthesis**
    *   **Source:** Generated a 14,000+ transaction dataset reflecting real-world B2B wholesale patterns (seasonality, perishability, shipping logic).
    *   **Scale:** 440 Customers, 12 Months, Complete Cost-to-Serve waterfall.
    *   **Tech:** Python (Pandas/NumPy) for ETL and Activity-Based Costing (ABC).

2.  **Financial Modeling (The Logic)**
    *   **Cost Allocation:** Moved beyond Gross Margin. allocated Warehouse, Shipping, and Admin costs *per transaction* to calculate True Net Margin.
    *   **Segmentation:** Clustered customers based on **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, not just Revenue.

3.  **Scenario Planning**
    *   Built a dynamic simulation engine to test "What If" strategic moves (e.g., "What if we raise prices 15% on the bottom 30% of customers?").

## 📣 Recommendations & Next Steps

Based on the validated data, I recommend a three-phased transformation plan to capture the identified profit opportunity.

### 1. Commercial Restructuring: The "C-Tier" Renegotiation
**Target:** 287 Accounts (65% of customer base) currently generating a net loss of €1.25M annually.

*   **Strategic Logic:** These customers generate €7.05M in revenue (48% of total) but consume disproportionate resources. The goal is not to fire them all, but to force them into a profitable operating model.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   **Price Indexing:** Implement a strategic price indexing strategy across the board for this segment to cover the service-cost gap.
    *   **Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ):** Establish a Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) threshold optimized for breakeven contribution. Data confirms orders below this threshold consistently yield negative contribution margins due to fixed picking/shipping costs.
    *   **Payment Terms:** Migrate from Net-90 to **Net-30 or Pre-paid**. This removes the working capital strain and interest expense associated with these high-risk accounts.
*   **Financial Validation:** Even if 50% of these customers churn (exit), the company could eliminate a significant portion of current operational losses. If the remaining 50% accept the terms, they have the potential to contribute significant new profit.

### 2. Operational Remediation: "Fresh" Category Cold Chain
**Target:** The "Fresh" product category, which drives the company-wide 7.80% return rate (2x industry benchmark).

*   **Strategic Logic:** The "Fresh" category is the highest revenue driver but also the largest source of operational leakage. The high return rate indicates systemic failures in temperature control or vendor quality, not just customer caprice.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   **Inbound QC:** Implement mandatory temperature logging at the receiving dock. Reject any inbound shipments deviating from strict safety windows.
    *   **Vendor Chargebacks:** Institute a "Cost of Quality" policy where suppliers are billed for returns attributed to spoilage within 24 hours of delivery.
    *   **Packaging Upgrade:** Invest in thermal liners for "Fresh" outbound shipments to reduce transit spoilage.
*   **Financial Validation:** Reducing the return rate from 7.8% to the industry standard of 4.0% could recover significant value based on current waste rates in direct logistics costs, restocking labor, and inventory write-offs.

### 3. Governance & Incentives: The "Margin-First" Pivot
**Target:** Sales Team and Account Management.

*   **Strategic Logic:** The disconnect between "Customer Count" (440) and "Net Profit" (€82k) proves that the Sales team is incentivized to sign *any* revenue, regardless of profitability.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   **Commission Structure:** Shift immediately from "Revenue %" to "**Contribution Margin %**". Pay zero commission on deals with a projected negative margin.
    *   **Clawback Clause:** Institute a policy where commissions are clawed back if a new customer generates a net loss in their first two quarters.
    *   **Gatekeeper Protocol:** Require Finance approval for any non-standard payment terms (e.g., Net-60+) for customers projecting low annual spend.
*   **Financial Validation:** Aligning incentives ensures that the €2.5M profit gains from Recommendations 1 and 2 are sustained and not eroded by future bad-faith acquisition.
